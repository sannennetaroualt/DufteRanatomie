Clinical: '<img src="paste-e54736c047f571d416d03053c622bdb3280742c7.jpg"><br>Respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn is due to inadequate production of surfactant. It leads to alveolar collapse, cyanosis, and difficulty in breathing. It may be life threatening in some premature infants and is the leading cause of death in preterm infants. Formerly called hyaline membrane disease, it is a common disease affecting 10% of premature infants.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-f55a03655baaa2b0aefd3b080a42637de090516f.jpg"><br>Comment: Type II pneumocytes are cuboidal cells that measure 10 to 12 um in diameter. They have a single, centrally placed euchromatic nucleus with 1 or 2 prominent nucleoli. Their cytoplasm contains a well-developed Golgi complex, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, scattered mitochondria, and many large, pleomorphic multilamellar bodies. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and proteins, coats the alveolar surfaces of the lung. It is synthesized and secreted by type Il pneumocytes and prevents alveolar collapse at the end of expiration by reducing surface tension. Multilamellar bodies in the cytoplasm of type II cells store the secretory product, which is discharged by exocytosis at the cell surface.'
