Title: 'Elastic Cartilage'

Clinical: '<img src="paste-14cde6f3a6611bd382f8189f3d25d3f3c2e1e8c1.jpg"><br>Disorders of elastic cartilage are uncommon. However, pseudocysts (or cystic chondromalacia) affect elastic cartilage in the auricle of the ear or the epiglottis. It is a benign, non- inflammatory intracartilagenous swelling accompanied by fibrosis and formation of granulation tissue. Although etiology is unknown, it is probably caused by ischemia to the perichondrium, which normally harbors the blood supply to this cartilage.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-28416d3e1d2845f158bb5841c9a3711b322fa2f3.jpg"><br>Comment: Elastic cartilage provides structural integrity to the auricle of the ear, epiglottis, and eustachian (auditory) tube. It is resilient, easily returning to its original shape after bending or distortion, and has more flexibility and elasticity than the other 2 types of cartilage. Its matrix contains a dense, interwoven network of elastic fibers embedded in a small amount of amorphous extracellular ground substance. The elastic fiber network is more dense in the interior than at the periphery. Chondrocytes in elastic cartilage are spherical in shape and are contained in lacunae. They are similar in appearance to chondrocytes of hyaline cartilage, except that they are more closely packed and commonly found singly in lacunae. Only a few isogenous nests of chondrocytes are present. The high refractive index of elastic fibers imparts a lightly eosinophilic staining pattern in conventional preparations. With special methods that selectively stain for elastin, the branching and anastomizing nature of the elastic fibers is demonstrated more clearly.'
