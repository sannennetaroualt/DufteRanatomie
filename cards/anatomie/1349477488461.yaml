Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> <b>Membranous labyrinth :</b>  Located within osseous labyrinth and contains endolymph.  Divided into 4 partsÑcochlear duct, saccule, utricle, and semicircular ducts<br> <b>Cochlear duct:</b>  Spiral structure located within cochlea that begins at blind end of cochlea at the apex and ends where it joins saccule via ductus reuniens. It is triangular in shape with base created by endosteum of canal known as spiral ligament and stria vascularis. Roof is formed by vestibular membrane that separates cochlear duct from scala vestibuli, and ßoor is formed by basilar membrane on which lies organ of Corti; separates duct from scala tympani.<br> <b>Saccule:</b>  Small structure located within vestibule of osseous labyrinth and connected to utricle via utriculosaccular duct and endolymphatic duct; contains sensory receptors (maculae).<br> <b>Utricle:</b>  Located within vestibule of osseous labyrinth and contains sensory receptors (maculae)<br> <b>Semicircular ducts:</b>  Correspond to semicircular canals of osseous labyrinth (anterior, posterior, and lateral) and open into utricle via 5 openings. Sensory receptors known as cristae are located in ampullae of semicircular ducts.'
