Clinical: '<img src="paste-e4c99fadfbddf4e42c24f03a9fc04b4867261dc8.jpg"><br>Congenital lymphedema is an inborn deficit of lymphatic vessels (usually in the lower limbs) that results in accumulation of lymph in the interstitial spaces of tissues. Swelling occurs when the volume of lymph exceeds the flow capacity of vessels.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-f5b3bcbab0379de25de8c264677bb708ad4252ad.jpg"><br>Comment: Cells of the lymphoid system are found in connective tissues throughout the body and can travel in the bloodstream or in lymphatic channels—the lymph-draining part of the circulatory system. By light microscopy, they are similar to capillaries and veins. Lymphatic vessels have wide distribution in many, but not all, body regions. Originating as blind-ended channels in connective tissue spaces, they are then thin-walled lymphatic capillaries (100 um in diameter) that anastomose and become larger. Lymphatic capillaries look similar to blood capillaries except that they lack a basal lamina. Small anchoring filaments connect endothelial cells to adjacent collagen fibers and help prevent vessel collapse. Lymphatic capillaries are most abundant in connective tissue of the skin (dermis); beneath mucous membranes of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts; and in connective tissue spaces of the liver.'
