Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b>  Acute otitis externa, better known as swimmer''s ear, is an inflammation or infection of the external ear. Acute otitis media (earache) is an inflammation of the middle ear and is common in children younger than age 15.<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The external ear consists of the auricle and the external acoustic meatus.  <br>The middle ear consists of the tympanic cavity and its 3 ossicles.  The lateral wall of the tympanic cavity is formed by the tympanic membrane (eardrum).  The medial wall contains the oval and round windows.  The auditory ossicles include the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup).  The middle ear connects to the nasopharynx by the auditory (eustachian) tube.  Via the auditory tube, air may enter or leave the middle ear cavity and equalize middle ear pressure with atmospheric pressure.  <br><br>The inner ear consists of the cochlea and the vestibular apparatus.  The acoustic apparatus and vestibular apparatus are innervated by CN VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve.  <br><br>The external ear is innervated by branches from CN V3, CN VII, and CN X.  The middle ear is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).  Acute otitis externa, better known as swimmerampersandapos;s ear, is an inflammation or infection of the external ear.  <br><br>Acute otitis media (earache) is an inflammation of the middle ear and is common in children younger than age 15.<br>'
