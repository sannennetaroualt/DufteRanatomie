Clinical: '<img src="paste-e76289dd3216b9d5176fb066a07ab50c2cecdc46.jpg"><br>Anemia is a deficiency of erythrocytes, of which there are many different types. Calculating the number of RBCs in peripheral blood, determining the concentration of hemoglobin, and examining the  morphology of erythrocytes in blood smears contribute to the correct diagnosis.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-8664c1beba703ca4fca07b31e15bf9737f35f7ab.jpg"><br>Comment: Erythrocytes are anucleate biconcave discs with an average diameter of 7.5 um. They represent 99% of the formed elements. Their normal numbers per liter of blood average 5 x 10^12 in men and 4.5 x 10^12? in women. Its biconcave shape provides a large surface area to carry out its primary function in transporting O2, from the lungs to the tissues and returning CO2, from the tissues to the lungs for elimination. The iron-containing protein, hemoglobin, accounts for their red color and rapidly binds to O2, for transport. Platelets are motile cytoplasmic fragments enveloped by a cell membrane that arise from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. They are the smallest formed elements in blood and appear as plate-like structures devoid of nuclei. They are 2 to 3 mum in diameter and number 250,000 to 350,000 per mm2.'
