Clinical: '<div>The pectoralis minor is normally thought of as acting from&nbsp;the ribs to depress and protract the scapula. However, it is&nbsp;also an effective accessory respiratory muscle in patients&nbsp;with dyspnea. In this case, the muscle acts from its&nbsp;attachment at the coracoid process to raise the ribs during&nbsp;inspiration. In order for this to be effective, the patient has&nbsp;to have the scapula braced so that the patient is typically&nbsp;seated with hands or elbows on a support such a table.</div>'
