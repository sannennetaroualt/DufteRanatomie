Clinical: '<img src="paste-0fa4de772009eadcba7941ec16728035ab466ede.jpg"><br>In ulcerative colitis, distal metaplasia of Paneth cells accompanies leukocyte infiltration of the lamina propria and distorted architecture of intestinal mucosa. Conversely, a loss of Paneth cells occurs in adult immune enteropathy.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-fff534b375be44283e36a38fae72c5368d4091d0.jpg"><br>Comment: Paneth cells are in the bases of crypts in the small intestine and appendix. They are most numerous in the ileum, and originate from undifferentiated stem cells, having a lifespan of 20 to 30 days. They mainly produce lysozyme, which regulates bacterial flora in the crypts. In hematoxylin and eosin sections, a distinct feature is the presence of prominent eosinophilic granules in the apical cytoplasm. Ultrastructurally, Paneth cells resemble other protein-secreting cells. The cytoplasm has many tightly packed and polarized organelles above a single, basal nucleus. Golgi-derived secretory vesicles are large and electron-dense. Vesicle contents are discharged by exocytosis by fusion of the vesicle’s limiting membrane with the apical plasma membrane.'
