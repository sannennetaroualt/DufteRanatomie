Clinical: '<img src="paste-bce6cf7dbce07214e28f5b80d19b7aea0ae35c73.jpg"><br>Guillain Barré Syndrome is a rare, rapidly progressive acute polyneuropathy characterized by motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction. It is an autoimmune disorder, and may occur after a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection, or following vaccination. Most patients have profoundly delayed conduction in nerve fibers due to demyelination of axons.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-c5d1eececaa541aba0b913bb8fe90ad12c76ff3c.jpg"><br>Comment: |nternodal regions of myelinated nerves in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are surrounded by concentric layers of Schwann cell plasma membrane that wrap around the nerve during development. Myelin is a lipoprotein wrapping with a high proportion of lipid to protein. The high lipid component of myelin consists of phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. Surrounding nerves, the perineurium consists of a supportive connective tissue and metabolically active perineurial cells that restrict the passage of a wide range of macromolecular substances, thereby regulating the internal microenvironment of the nerve.'
