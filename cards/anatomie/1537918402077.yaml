Clinical: '<div>The ansa cervicalis is composed of a series of loops of&nbsp;nerve twigs from C1 to C3 that innervate the infrahyoid&nbsp;muscles, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and omohyoid. The&nbsp;superior root of the ansa cervicalis briefly travels with&nbsp;and is affixed to the hypoglossal nerve, but there is no&nbsp;intermingling of fibers between the two nerves. Thus, it&nbsp;is incorrect to suggest that any of the infrahyoid muscles&nbsp;are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve&nbsp;XII), which does innervate almost all of the muscles of the&nbsp;tongue. Clearly then, a brainstem lesion that affects the&nbsp;hypoglossal nucleus would not affect the actions of these&nbsp;muscles.</div>'
