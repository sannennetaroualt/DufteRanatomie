Clinical: '<img src="paste-bb414dc17e70fdcdc3cfd3789cca91e1a00e426f.jpg"><br>Paget’s disease (osteitis deformans) of bone results from an imbalance in activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the bone- remodeling process. New bone that is laid down is soft and porous, and can easily bend and break. Only a small number of bones are typically affected in this disease.'

They are polarized cells that synthesize and secrete unmineralized osteoid, which later becomes mineralized. Its main components include type | collagen and the glycoproteins, osteocalcin and osteopontin. Osteoblasts also synthesize alkaline phosphatase, a cell surface protein that promotes mineralization and formation of hydroxyapatite in the bony matrix. As ossification proceeds, osteoblasts become entrapped in the bony matrix and are termed osteocytes. Osteoclasts are specialized multinucleated cells whose major role is to resorb bone by maintaining a low pH in the resorption cavity.'
