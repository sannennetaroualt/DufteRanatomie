Clinical: '<img src="paste-e5435787a054ce05e757d0ffbd76f9dbc589aeec.jpg"><br>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic disease that manifests predominantly in diarthroidal joints. The earliest changes are injury to the synovial microvasculature, endothelial swelling, and hyperplasia of type A and type B synoviocytes. Aggregates of CD4+ T lymphocytes and diffuse infiltrates of CD8+ cells characterize the subintimal layer.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-d85fdc27ec1ed692b99b51612e885fdf77878c09.jpg"><br>Comment: The synovium is a delicate and highly vascularized lining of the synovial joint. The intimal lining cells, known as synoviocytes, are modified connective tissue cells rather than epithelial cells. They form 1 or 2 cellular layers concentrated along the luminal surface, giving the false impression of a continuous cellular “membrane” characteristic of epithelia. However, the synoviocytes are not joined by intercellular junctions and are devoid of a basement membrane. Two types of cells are present in the lining cells: Type A synoviocytes (20% to 30%), which are modified phagocytes derived from blood monocytes, and Type B synoviocytes, which are modified fibroblasts that synthesize glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins. Synovial fluid is mainly an ultrafiltrate of blood and secretions of type B synoviocytes.'
