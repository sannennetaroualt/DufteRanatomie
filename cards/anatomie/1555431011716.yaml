To determine whether it has spread to other sites, staging of this type of stomach cancer is done by  computed tomography scans and blood tests for tumor markers (such as carcinoembryonic antigen).'
Comment: '<img src="paste-5d573c786d55604a26644a184420ae735bc36675.jpg"><br>Comment: Gastric chief cells are mostly seen in the basal parts of gastric glands in the stomach. They are typical protein-synthesizing cells that produce 2 types of proteolytic enzymes (pepsinogen | and Il) as well as lipase, another digestive enzyme. Chief cells are cuboidal to columnar in shape. They have a round basal nucleus and an apical cytoplasm with many zymogen granules. Their ultrastructure closely resembles that of pancreatic acinar cells. Zymogen granules are large membrane-bound secretory vesicles derived from the Golgi complex. They discharge their contents by exocytosis at the apex of the cell.'
