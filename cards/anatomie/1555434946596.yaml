Clinical: '<img src="paste-c815c0b3d84912628608e73751c9f1309be87453.jpg"><br>The Italian microscopist Marcello Malphigi (1628-1694) discovered renal corpuscles and tubules. Freidrich Henle (1809-1885) from Germany contributed to the study of the kidney, and the thin, looped part of the nephron bears his name. The English histologist Sir William Bowman (1816-1892) identified the capsule of the renal corpuscle—Bowman’s capsule.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-7a1e0230797f6b42d4752312b39f145a1dc71a51.jpg"><br>Comment: The uriniferous tubule consists of the highly coiled nephron (30 to 40 mm long) and excretory collecting ducts (20 mm long). It is the functional unit of the kidney. Each adult kidney has more than 1 million uriniferous tubules. A nephron is a blind-ended tubule composed of renal corpuscle, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule. The histology of each part reflects functional differences. Nephrons empty into collecting tubules, which form larger collecting ducts that convey urine to the renal pelvis. Renal corpuscles and convoluted parts of proximal and distal tubules are in the cortex, whereas Henle’s loops and collecting ducts are in the medulla.'
