Clinical: '<img src="paste-77b6157c26f0a123539b1e29dc871fcf37e51ef6.jpg"><br>Stomach cancer may develop in any part of the organ, but the most frequent site of occurrence is close to the esophago-gastric junction. Gastric adenocarcinoma—the most common type—is a malignant tumor originating in the glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Diagnosis is by endoscopic examination and biopsy. It has a tendency to invade the gastric wall and metastasize to other organs.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-f859eb3c8a82ca498cac1e0bd73d015de28a33a1.jpg"><br>Comment: Gastric mucosa is highly cellular and consists of simple columnar epithelium, underlying lamina propria, and deeper muscularis mucosae. Surface mucous cells extend into gastric pits, which lead into long, tubular gastric glands. The glands are so tightly packed that the lamina propria is difficult to distinguish and often appears scanty. Each gland shows 3 regions: an apical isthmus, neck, and body (main part) with a slightly dilated, coiled base. Mucous neck cells, parietal cells, chief cells, and enteroendocrine cells comprise the main gastric glands of the body and fundus of the stomach.'
