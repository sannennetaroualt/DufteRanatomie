Clinical: '<img src="paste-7d2eb5d56933d1e24c60fbe0045229f730dcae6b.jpg"><br>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the myocardium, often resulting in sudden cardiac death. It is most often a familial disorder (65%), with an autosomal dominant transmission. Abnormal growth and hypertrophy of cardiac muscle cells results in ventricular wall thickening, and the myocardial cells are disarrayed instead of displaying a normal arrangement.'

Cardiac muscle cells (also known as myocardial cells or cardiomyocytes) contain the same basic organization of myofibrils, myofilaments, and cross-striations as in skeletal muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells are smaller and contain a single centrally placed nucleus, although they may sometimes be binucleated. Cells are joined together by specialized junctions called intercalated discs.'
