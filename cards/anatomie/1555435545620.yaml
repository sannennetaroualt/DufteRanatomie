Clinical: '<img src="paste-bf5319d9ec9182fd63d003ec5515ac64e9de8138.jpg"><br>Urethritis—an inflammation of the urethra—affects men and women equally. It may be caused by bacterial or viral infection, and is often associated with sexually transmitted disease (STD). Gonococcal urethritis usually has a shorter incubation period than the nongonococcal form of the disease.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-3c02e12179d9f7f879dfaaf773bb975e995ecbe8.jpg"><br>Comment: The female urethra is about 4 cm long and 8 mm wide. It has 3 concentric layers: mucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Its crescent-shaped lumen is lined by transitional epithelium that gradually changes to stratified columnar, and then stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium at its opening into the vestibule. Invaginations of epithelium form mucus-secreting urethral glands, and the lamina propria has an extensive venous plexus. The male urethra, 15 to 20 cm long, is divided into 3 segments: prostatic, membranous, and spongy. Like that in the female urethra, the epithelium of the male urethra shows similar regional changes.'
