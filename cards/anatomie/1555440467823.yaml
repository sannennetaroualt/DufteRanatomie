Clinical: '<img src="paste-3f02588023dc841cb88d7cce0dbb8c8f9cef7289.jpg"><br>Because the main neural pathway for transmission of sensory information from Meissner’s and Pacinian corpuscles to the cerebral cortex is the dorsal column-medial leminscus, lesions of this system affect 2 point tactile discrimination and sensation of vibration. Such deficits may be due to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), commonly known as a stroke.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-8469d9a1c44616ee48b869986a6bc5ad4f7a352c.jpg"><br>Comment: Meissner’s and Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting encapsulated mechanoreceptors in dermis of fingertips, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Pacinian corpuscles also occur in mesenteries, periosteum of bone, genital organs, and near tendinous insertions and joint capsules. Meissner’s corpuscles in dermal papillae are sensitive to fine tactile stimuli, whereas Pacinian corpuscles, which are usually deep in the dermis and subcutaneous connective tissue of skin, respond to pressure, vibration, and gross tactile stimuli. Both receptors are supplied by a single sensory nerve fiber enveloped by multiple capsular lamellae, which are formed by flattened perineurial cells.'
